# pedometer
A pedometer is a device:
  - portable and electronic or electromechanical
  - counts each step a person takes by detecting the motion of the person's hands or hips.
 
Pedometers can be a motivation tool for people wanting to increase their physical activity.
It have been shown in clinical studies to reduce blood pressure levels and body mass index in. 

The main idea was to make a device that measures the physical performance of each individual where the pedometer at each movement:
  - verifies the distance traveled.
  - the number of steps performed.
  - the calories lost.
  - the ambient temperature.
  - humidity measurement.

It is necessary to recognize physical activity as an important element for normal metabolic activities as well as reducing the risks of future diseases.
